# Overview
The provided file is an analysis of tennis players' performance, sponsors, and social interaction. The analysis aims to quantitatively test the phenomenon of sponsors' influence on tennis, particularly in women's tennis, and to see if there are any differences with men's tennis. 

The following information is combined for the analysis:

Sports performance data, such as the number of tournaments won, prize money, and winning percentage.

Data on sponsors: which brands collaborate with the tennis players.

Google trends data: the most searched information related to a tennis player and their association with tennis.

Number of followers and posts on Instagram to estimate the athlete's social engagement.

The report outlines the data acquisition process, including sponsor data, performance data, Instagram data, and Google Trends data. It also discusses data quality and conflicts between data sources, such as name format problems, missing values related to sponsors, and inaccurate values related to performance statistics.

The report concludes with the construction of a relational database to integrate the collected data for further analysis and the creation of an interactive Tableau infographic to summarize the findings.
